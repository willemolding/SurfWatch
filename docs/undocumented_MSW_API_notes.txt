The magic seaweed API does not list all its functioanlity on its documentation page. Here are some additional features I have found through experimentation




##Spot API##

It is possible to look up spots near a lat-lon position using the API. You can do this using the /spot api

http://magicseaweed.com/api/"+msw_key+"/spot

This accepts the following parameter that I know of:
- lat //(required)
- lon //(required)
- fields //limit the fields to return

It will return a json listing the details of all nearby spots




##Tide API##

MSW also has a pretty good tide API

http://magicseaweed.com/api/"+msw_key+"/tide/

That accepts the following parameters

- spot_id // (required)
- start // UTC timestamp for the start of the data
- end // UTC timstamp for the end of the data

It returns a JSON with a bunch of tide events split in to days. It also include sun rise and sun set times. All times are given as UTC.
